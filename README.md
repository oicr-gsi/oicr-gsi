## Genome Sequence Informatics

The GSI team at [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](https://oicr.on.ca) is a team of
bioinformaticians and software developers that develop, maintain, and operate the core 
analysis infrastructure, analyze genomic data produced at the institute, and support
collaborators and researchers with their bioinformatics analysis.

To support these activities, we have developed a large suite of open-source software
that can be found under our Github organizations: [oicr-gsi](https://github.com/oicr-gsi)
and [miso-lims](https://github.com/miso-lims).

### Laboratory tracking

To support our wetlab colleagues, we develop a variety of apps for laboratory tracking
that also play nicely with downstream computational tools.

* [MISO LIMS](https://github.com/miso-lims/miso-lims) : laboratory information management 
  system specifically for sequencing facilities.
* [RAMEN](https://github.com/miso-lims/ramen) : minimalist inventory control system for 
  sequencing facilities
* [Run Scanner](https://github.com/miso-lims/runscanner) : web server that monitors output 
  from sequencing instruments (Illumina, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore) and reports their 
  status and metrics
  
For more of our lab tracking software, visit the [miso-lims](https://github.com/miso-lims)
Github organisation.

### Pipeline Infrastructure

One of our main goals is to automate as much analysis, validation, and reporting as possible
and we've built a suite of APIs and software to help.
