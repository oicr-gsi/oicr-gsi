OICR Genome Sequence Informatics documentation
==============================================

GSI is a team of bioinformaticians and software developers at `Ontario Institute for Cancer Research`_ that develop, maintain, and operate the core analysis infrastructure, analyze genomic data produced at the institute, and support collaborators and researchers with their bioinformatics analysis. To support these activities, we have developed a large suite of open-source software that can be found under our Github organizations: `oicr-gsi`_ and `miso-lims`_.
